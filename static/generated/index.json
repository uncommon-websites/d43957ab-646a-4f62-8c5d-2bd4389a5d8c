    "prompt": "Candid photograph of a professional operations manager in a modern, sunlit office, captured mid-celebration after a successful achievement. The scene uses soft, natural golden-hour light streaming through large windows, with subtle amber highlights reflecting accomplishment. The manager, dressed in sophisticated neutrals with a hint of golden accent, stands near an organized desk with physical documents and a coffee cup, radiating calm satisfaction. The environment is minimal and authentic, with clean lines, muted earth tones, and gentle film-style grain. Expression is quietly joyful and body language is relaxed yet confident, embodying a sense of effortless mastery and human-centered operational excellence.",
